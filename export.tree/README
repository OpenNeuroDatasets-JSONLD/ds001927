### Data 
Twenty-three healthy participants underwent three counterbalanced rTMS-fMRI sessions on different days, where a prefrontal (FRO), an occipital (OCC) and a temporo-parietal control (CTR) region were identically stimulated with low-frequency (1Hz) rTMS. We measured brain activity with resting state-fMRI before (rest-pre) and immediately after stimulation (rest-post).

### Analysis

The following table contains a description of the configuration's or script files needed for the data analysis:

Filename| Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
pipeline_config_cpac_v0.3.9.2.yml | YAML| Configuration file pipeline for CPAC v0.3.9.2 which runs the pre-processing, FC, timeseries generation and local signal analysis
fca_file_extract.sh | Bash | Extracts and organizes the FCA's files for the statistical analysis
anova_rm_spm_batch.mat | Matlab | SPM's batch configuration file for the one-way repeated measures ANOVA second level analysis
spm_contrast_vis.py | Python | Visualizes the statistically significant contrast's images by overlaying them on a glass brain representation
cons_mod_calc.m | Matlab | Extracts the timeseries generated by CPAC and runs the consensus modularity analysis
cons_mod_stats_vis.py | Python | Visualizes and runs the statistical analysis on the consensus modularity analysis results
cv_classifier.py | Python | Extracts the features and run the cross-validated classification on them
local_signal_extraction.sh | Bash | Extracts and masks the local signal analysis files for the statistical analysis
sDCM.m | Matlab | Extracts the timeseries generated by CPAC and runs the spectral DCM analysis
